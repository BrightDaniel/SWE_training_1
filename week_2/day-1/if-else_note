Conditionals in shell

what are conditional Statement in shell?

Conditional statements evaluate between two or more conditions and make a decision. They decide based on the conditions that comes out true or false.

There are total 5 conditional statements which can be used in bash programming

if statement
if-else statement
if..elif..else..fi statement (Else If ladder)
if..then..else..if..then..fi..fi..(Nested if)
switch statement
Their description with syntax is as follows:

if statement
This block will process if specified condition is true.
Syntax:

if [ expression ]
then
   statement
fi

if-else statement
If specified condition is not true in if part then else part will be execute.
Syntax:

if [ expression ]
then
   statement1
else
   statement2
fi


if..elif..else..fi statement (Else If ladder)
To use multiple conditions in one if-else block, then elif keyword is used in shell. If expression1 is true then it executes statement 1 and 2, and this process continues. If none of the condition is true then it processes else part.
Syntax

if [ expression1 ]
then
   statement1
   statement2
   .
   .
elif [ expression2 ]
then
   statement3
   statement4
   .
   .
else
   statement5
fi


switch statement
case statement works as a switch statement if specified value match with the pattern then it will execute a block of that particular pattern
When a match is found all of the associated statements until the double semicolon (;;) is executed.
A case will be terminated when the last command is executed.
If there is no match, the exit status of the case is zero.


Syntax:

case  in
   Pattern 1) Statement 1;;
   Pattern n) Statement n;;

EXAMPLE PROGRAMS

Example 1
Implementing if statement

#Initializing two variables
a=10
b=20
  
#Check whether they are equal
if [ $a == $b ]
then
    echo "a is equal to b"
fi
  
#Check whether they are not equal
if [ $a != $b ]
then
    echo "a is not equal to b"
fi

Example 2.
Implementing if.else statement

#Initializing two variables
a=20
b=20
  
if [ $a == $b ]
then
    #If they are equal then print this
    echo "a is equal to b"
else
    #else print this
    echo "a is not equal to b"
fi

Example 3:
Implementing switch statement

CARS="bmw"

#Pass the variable in string
case "$CARS" in
	#case 1
	"mercedes") echo "Headquarters - Affalterbach, Germany" ;;
	
	#case 2
	"audi") echo "Headquarters - Ingolstadt, Germany" ;;
	
	#case 3
	"bmw") echo "Headquarters - Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India" ;;
